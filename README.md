TriagePic-Win7
==============

TriagePic-Win7 is a Windows desktop version of TriagePic (suitable for XP/Vista/Win7/Win8). In general, TriagePic is designed to capture photos and minimal information about mass casualty arrivals at a hospital triage station.  Data is reported by web services to a (typically) hospital-hosted version of NLM's People Locator, referred to as "TriageTrak", where family reunification and other hospital staffers may consult it.  People Locator is related to open-source "Vesuvius" from Sahana Software Foundation.

To get access to TriagePic-Win7, first get TriageTrak hospital staff credentials (see the TriagePic-WinStore wiki article about that).  Then using them, log on to triagetrak.nlm.nih.gov.  In the left column, select "TriagePic", and follow further instructions in the tabbed sections.
